# Inspiration

I was inspired with Jay Jamison video and his passion to make things easier for business. I was so excited with Quick Base idea, that showed it to my friends who manages their businesses, and they said - it's fantastic, but we still have to hire developers to test hypothesis.

This time Quicky idea came to my mind. Make a service where business people could just talk their requirements and build amazing applications powered by Quick Base. I postpone all by projects and focused on this idea, I worked full-time for 4 weeks to deliver Quicky on time!
